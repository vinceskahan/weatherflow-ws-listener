## Weatherflow WS Listener

This is a quick script to set up a websocket to WF's servers and listen to our data as they see it.


### Usage

```
# edit the file to set your device and station id(s)
# if you only have one Sky, comment out the blocks for sky2
# run 'python3 weatherflow-ws-listener.py' for interactive data
```
